//  2. If insiders mode is on, unioning in every flag from InsidersFeatureFlags.
//     Insiders is a server-controlled meta switch, so its expansion is NOT
//     re-validated against AllowedFeatureFlags.
//
// AllowedFeatureFlags and InsidersFeatureFlags are independent sets:
//   - A flag in AllowedFeatureFlags but not InsidersFeatureFlags is a regular
//     opt-in flag that insiders mode does not turn on automatically.
//   - A flag in InsidersFeatureFlags but not AllowedFeatureFlags is reachable
//     only through insiders mode and cannot be enabled by user input.
//
// Returns a set (map) for O(1) lookup by the feature checker.
